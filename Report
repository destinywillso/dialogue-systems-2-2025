/* lab2 Report
  For part one, the main difficulty was that the system randomly generated some numbers 
and letters because I hadn't followed the correct sequence of messages. I fixed this 
problem by appending the new message to the end of the array instead of the head. 
Meanwhile, I changed the rule for Speaking, making it speak the last message in the array.

  For part two, I used to set up an independent state for no_input. In the end, I changed 
it to be part of Ask, using a blank string as the user's input and passing this blank 
content to the LLM to generate a response. Fortunately, it works.
